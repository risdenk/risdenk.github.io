### Overview
[Hortonworks Data Flow (HDF)](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-platforms/hdf/) released version 3.1 on February 1, 2018. [HDF 3.1 includes](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDF3/HDF-3.1.0/bk_release-notes/content/ch_hdf_relnotes.html) [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) 1.5.0. NiFi 1.4.0 introduced improved [Apache Ranger](https://ranger.apache.org/) integration with [NIFI-4032](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4032). The new integration has a bad `RangerNiFiAuthorizer` memory leak - [NIFI-4925](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4925).

### Debugging Apache NiFi `RangerNiFiAuthorizer` Memory Leak
We upgraded our development HDF 3.0 cluster to HDF 3.1 on February 22. After upgrading, we noticed that there was a significant increase in the amount of heap being used. Over teh course of less than a few hours, the heap usage exceeded 95% and the cluster became unresponsive. We started eliminating variables and made sure we hadn't made any changes to our NiFi flows that had been working with HDF 3.0.

By Tuesday 2/27, we had eliminated all potential confounding variables and started to investigate this as a potential NiFi bug. We gathered a heap dump on one of the nodes and ran an analysis on it. We found the following:

> One instance of "org.apache.nifi.authorization.AuthorizerFactory$2" loaded by "org.apache.nifi.nar.NarClassLoader @ 0x3cd41a5c0" occupies 12,250,365,064 (84.18%) bytes. The memory is accumulated in one instance of "java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap$Node[]" loaded by "<system class loader>".

The heap analysis report showed that the cause of the above message was a `ConcurrentHashMap` in the [`RangerNiFiAuthorizer` class](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ranger-bundle/nifi-ranger-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/ranger/authorization/RangerNiFiAuthorizer.java) that had grown uncontrollably. The [`RangerNiFiAuthorizer` class](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ranger-bundle/nifi-ranger-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/ranger/authorization/RangerNiFiAuthorizer.java) was introduced as part of [NIFI-4032](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4032). The [variable `resultLookup`](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ranger-bundle/nifi-ranger-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/ranger/authorization/RangerNiFiAuthorizer.java#L74) was being added to and not necessarily being [cleaned up](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ranger-bundle/nifi-ranger-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/ranger/authorization/RangerNiFiAuthorizer.java#L209).

On Wednesday 2/28, we opened a support case with Hortonworks to try to fix this Apache NiFi bug. By Friday 3/2, Hortonworks had identified the issue and was working on a hot fix for us. This is being tracked publically as [NIFI-4925](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4925). 

### What is next?
We are looking forward to [NIFI-4925](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4925) being resolved quickly and applying the hot fix to our environment. A release of Apache NiFi 1.4.x and 1.5.x could also fix the open source versions of Apache NiFi. This could be included in a HDF 3.1.x release as well.
